# malaria_detection
A CNN Model which helps in predicting whether a particular cell has a Plasmodium parasite or no. Different models have being used (Sequential, Functional) and custom layers are also added. Much more modifications have to be done to improve accuracy like transfer learning. The dataset used is the one which is present in the tensorflow library, which in turn has been taken from https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-downloads/downloads.html#malaria-datasets. For the source code of the malaria dataset builder, visit https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/datasets/malaria/malaria_dataset_builder.py.
